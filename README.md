This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in R programming related to data frame subsetting.  The `bug.r` file contains code that incorrectly uses the assignment operator `=` where the equality comparison operator `==` should be used. This results in unexpected behavior. The corrected code is shown in `bugSolution.r`.  This example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when working with R's subsetting syntax.
